# Am I Cooked?

An anonymous social platform where users share their wildest experiences, controversial thoughts, or questionable decisions, and let the community rate them on a "cooked" scale of 1-100.

## What is "Cooked"?

In internet slang, being "cooked" means making questionable life choices, having wild unbelievable experiences, or sharing thoughts that make people wonder about your life decisions. It's essentially being a hot mess in the best possible way.

## Key Features

### Anonymous Posting

- Share your stories without revealing your identity
- Raw, unfiltered content from real experiences
- Focus on content, not the creator

### The Cooked Scale (1-100)

- Community rates how "cooked" your post is
- 1 = Mildly questionable (just a little crispy)
- 100 = Absolutely unhinged (fully burnt to a crisp)
- Real-time score updates as users vote

### Time-Limited Posts

- Every post has an expiration timer
- Creates urgency and freshness
- Final cooked score revealed when time's up

### Leaderboards & Rankings

- Top Cooked Posts of the Week
- Most Controversial Takes
- Hall of Fame (or Shame?)

### Privacy-First Design

- True anonymity - no user profiles needed
- Posts automatically purge after expiration
- Minimal data collection

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Session-based (minimal, for voting only)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Nginx, Gunicorn

## How It Works

1. **Share Your Story**: Post your wild experience anonymously
2. **Get Rated**: Community votes on how "cooked" you are (1-100 scale)
3. **Watch the Timer**: Post expires after set time (e.g., 24 hours)
4. **See Your Score**: Final cooked rating revealed when time expires
5. **Leaderboards**: See where you rank among other cooked individuals

## Perfect For

- Sharing that story you can't tell anyone you know
- Getting anonymous feedback on questionable decisions
- Reading hilarious, unbelievable real-life experiences
- Entertainment, laughs, and occasional facepalms

## Why This Project?

- **Unique Concept**: No other platform focuses on the "cooked" rating system
- **Engagement**: Time-limited posts create urgency and interaction
- **Viral Potential**: Wild stories naturally attract attention
- **Lighthearted Fun**: Internet culture meets social interaction

## Design Philosophy

"If you're not getting rated on the cooked scale, are you even living?"

- Clean, modern interface
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Intuitive voting system
- Real-time updates without page refreshes

## Future Roadmap

- Mobile app development
- "Cooked Categories" (Relationships, Career, Money, etc.)
- Achievement badges ("Burnt Out", "Slightly Toasted", "Fully Cooked")
- Weekly digest emails
- Advanced analytics for posts
- Moderation tools for community safety
